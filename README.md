# IZR
IZR Token Fund Token Prototype for IDEO CoLab.

#### _What am I looking at?_

IZR is a prototype of an investing platform dedicated to helping make crytoinvesting accessible to everyone. 

#### _How do I run it?_

IZR is built on top of Truffle, a smart contract framework that makes it easy to create DAPPs (distributed web apps). Installing truffle is not neccesary to open and view the IZR platform, but it must be installed to tinker with the smart contract. (At this time there is only an incredibly basic smart contract dedicated to restricting access to specific parts of the platform.) 

Truffle can be installed with the command:

`$ npm install -g truffle` 

In order to run the platform, you must run the following command from the root directory: 

`npm run start`

If you do not have NPM or node installed, googling installation instructions is your best bet.

#### _Why smart contracts?_

Our core technology is the blockchain, so we wanted to try to apply that wherever possible. The smart contract code is bare right now, but in the future we see it being used to moniter client's holdings, or to keep strategies updated as effeciently as possible.
